# Job simulation
We beleive that there are some core skills requiered for software engineers that majority of courses generally dont' dig into.

Things like:
- Reading other people's code
- reading documentations and understanding usage of different libraries and tools used in production in real life projects.
- Reviewing other people's code
- Understanding and following best practices of contribution flow:  commiting/reviewing/merging/releasing using "Git".
- Debugging real life problems 
- Understanding relational/non-relational database design/usage
- Understanding business requirement parts of software engineering
- Implementing whole features ( From REST endpoints to database migrations )
- Using docker and other utility, devops tools.

Each of the projects listed below are these kinds of simulations.
Make sure to check it out:)

# General idea and goal of the projects
Each and every project listed below is project of different level(Easy, Medium, Hard), implemented using different technologies/frameworks,
and they all solve theoritical business needs in different domains(for more fun). All of them needs some modification/bug fix/feature implementation, which you should do.


## All of the projects, using all the different technologies have according, curated, tested resources,documents for learning attached. and you can always schedule a meeting with your mentor who can help with direct tasks or give further recommendations.

- Choose project of your according level, of needed technology/framework and in according domain.
- Clone the project on your local machine.
- For each level/type of the project there are tickets/bugs/features to be implemented. All of these features can be found in github issues
(Later we might think of a better way to track todo list)
- It is recommended to start from easier tasks/bugs: tagged with level:0 (which typically is a small hotfix, small feature or etc), and end with whole feature implementations: tagged with level MAX.
- For each task/issue that you should complete there will be a detailed  explanation and information on what needs to be done, in case of confusion
contact the mentor, with whom you can setup daily one on one or group meetings.
-  Upon finishing each issue/task make a Pull request( just in case you can also ping your mentor ). You will get code reviewed by our team members and will receive recommendations for best practices.

# Concrete skills you will develop ( for each technology mentioned there are the same )
- Debugging, finding and fixing buggy REST endpoints.
- Understanding HTTP protocol and REST endpoints by implementing them from scratch.
- Understanding and using Layered architecture of modern day web applications.
- Unit/Integration testing and their importance 
- Database table structure design from scratch for additional features, and communicating with it.
- Using ORM and database connectivity layer libraries.
- Documenting your API with industry standards.
